        question: "What is the PDS Protocol?",
        answer: "The PDS (Personal Data Store) Protocol is a decentralized framework designed to give individuals control over their own data while enabling secure and seamless interactions between applications and services. It allows users to store their personal data in a private, user-controlled environment rather than relying on centralized platforms. <br /><br /> By using standardized APIs and authentication mechanisms, the PDS Protocol ensures that users can grant or revoke access to their data as needed, promoting privacy, security, and interoperability across different services. This approach empowers individuals to manage their digital identity and share information on their own terms while reducing dependence on large tech companies that traditionally store and monetize user data.",
